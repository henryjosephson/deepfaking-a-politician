/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice161.wav| And so I always tense up a little bit when I hear legislators say, I'm not going to vote for anything in this whole sector unless it includes a and someone else has not unless it includes B and someone else not include C.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice130.wav| when the units themselves are sold, that is taxed. And of course, the income of the residents that live in those buildings are taxed.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice78.wav| only because of all of the money that's being invested in it, but because it can speed up its own research. One of the things that generative AI is best at is coding.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice8.wav| those have to be nice to them.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice77.wav| So it's a yes and approach to this. The other bit that people miss with AI is that this is going to move faster than any technology before.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice158.wav| But we've been putting forward our own proposals as well. Obviously, I don't think anyone would say that our job is done. We haven't passed something.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice21.wav| But part of it is being comfortable with legislators enough to say, hey, here are the caveats and here's what we're ensuring.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice71.wav| The answer to whether we should be excited or fearful of AI is yes. The bounds of what's possible with AI are as wide as any technology we've ever invented.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice20.wav| actually reference some in my say the district or email the firm and they were like oh you actually understand like they're like you wanted in a CSV or shape files like I've never asked a legislator this.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice116.wav| and a human signed up, took the job, and actually chatted with OpenAI and said, oh, you're not a robot, are you? Ha, ha.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice91.wav| But I thought that was a creative way to reach out to people in their own language. Just, you know, be transparent about what exactly is happening. How government uses AI will be more and more part of the conversation. So ITS,
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice35.wav| And judicial reform is a very big topic in a lot of different places we could go with it, but my focus for this year and my top priority across my entire legislative portfolio is enabling there to be more judges. So...
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice36.wav| Our trials are crazy backlogged. That backlog was growing before the pandemic. It really spiked during it. 2023, we actually had slightly good news.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice4.wav| reforms that we think will make the government more effective and efficient.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice145.wav| that is actually looking at how we under-tax vacant land. I grew up in New York City, and it was a whole new world.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice73.wav| When we were first investigating splitting the atom, the bounds of possibilities were unlimited, clean energy for all with no waste through fusion and extinction through nuclear bombs.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice129.wav| When you build housing, you're creating construction jobs, you're creating demand for businesses, and those businesses will pay taxes.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice142.wav| York City or Albany, I think it's reasonable for us to put a little bit of money into funding those repairs. I was proud to work with Assemblymember Ed Bronstein this year to pass a new version of the J51 program that provided tax breaks for people to do necessary repairs. But I want to go even further in saying if this is a rent-regulated unit and it's truly you need to do repairs to get it up to code, the government should put a bunch of money in to help support that. And the way I've come up to pay for that is actually looking at how we under-tax vacant land. You know, I grew up in New York City and it was always shocking to me that there was any vacant land in New York City. It just makes no sense and it turns out the reason that some of that is, is we hardly under-tax it. No property in New York is actually taxed at its market value and that's a good thing. I'm not saying we should massively raise those taxes, but it is egregious when you look at vacant land that we are so under-taxing it. If we just taxed holes in the ground in New York City at the market value for a hole in the ground, not what it'll be once it's built up, not its potential, just what it would sell for on the open market today, that would raise an extra $800 million a year for New York City. Now, maybe we don't go the full way. Maybe we look at housing versus commercial. There's details to be worked out there, but that's a subsidy to not bill that makes no sense. And so if we can take some of that potential revenue, put that towards funding repairs for rent-regulated apartments, maybe we can introduce a little more building on vacant land and get more of those vacant units back online. Is that something that the different groups that represent the rent-stabilized building owners and operators, are they on board with this proposal? Because what I've heard mostly from them, and I haven't checked in on their full agenda lately and I do want to have an episode of the show sometime in the coming months on this issue, but last time I sort of heard from them, their main proposal was more allow the sort of their market, their owners to.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice117.wav| And chat gbt responded and said oh no i just have a visual impairment like thank you for helping. That's scary.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice118.wav| thing and they disclose that they did the right thing they made changes but we're in the very early days of what these programs can do and so
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice49.wav| There's a deep long history of how the New York court system has come to be and actually think it'd be a great idea for an event for New York law school. Right. Yes. Far beyond even what I know about it.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice97.wav| Government deals with really serious issues, and when we're having that, we need to have a higher scale of audit on these systems.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice133.wav| I don't think that's enough to solve the problem, but given that this is an existential crisis, as you mentioned, we should be looking at everything that can help the problem.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice17.wav| But on the inside, I mean, we have fairly thick reports available to us on what certain policies may or may not do.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice157.wav| Obviously there were some differences with the governor there and you know Albany it takes three to tango not two which is why it's such an awkward dance.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice45.wav| And as long as there's a constitutional limit, we can't even have that conversation first. But no, largely most people are in support. It's just a constitutional amendment, which.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice102.wav| And so they came together to form a consortium to build a large data center for the universities, put it right next to the river and powered it by hydropower.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice34.wav| And I know we're going to talk a little bit about kind of judicial reform, but looking at how long trials take and what the ultimate adjudication of cases are might tell us more than the total number of arrests going into the system.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice62.wav| by speeding up the trials that we're seeing.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice109.wav| that, but it'll also be really good for the economy, for jobs, because if the universities can recruit the best AI researchers to New York State, well then that ends up spinning off new companies, that ends up building the whole ecosystem.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice43.wav| If they are, they're quiet about it. But we haven't heard much opposition. What we do here occasionally is, judges are expensive, is that the best use of state money?
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice107.wav| A, because I think it'll allow more AI safety research, how we can make sure that these systems are doing what we want, that they're aligned with human interests and that we have the right checks and understanding of them.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice59.wav| The analysis we're doing actively. The version of this that I like to tell is that Rikers, the New York City jail, which again, 85% of the people held there are waiting trial, right? They haven't yet been convicted. That's the general definition of a jail versus a prison. So Rikers, which is a New York City jail, has the longest average length of stay of any jail in the country.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice108.wav| which is research that universities are really leading in. There's less incentive perhaps for parts of the private sector to do.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice137.wav| by putting a little bit of surcharge on warehouse units or on vacant units or ones where there's really no effort in order to bring it out to the public and allow people to live there for at least six months out of the year. Now I think most people
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice72.wav| The answer to whether we should be excited or fearful of AI is yes. The bounds of what's possible with AI are as wide as any technology we've ever invented. The only thing that comes close is thinking about nuclear power, right?
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice79.wav| And it's not yet coding itself. We haven't reached the singularity for any of sci-fi fans, but well, you could get there.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice67.wav| process, you know, when you get to an idea that seems common sense and everyone's for it, it hasn't happened. There's probably a reason.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice48.wav| So it's important that everyone understands how much this affects your day-to-day, how much this affects just the functioning of government, and why it's so important to support this reform.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice82.wav| To get into some of the specifics of that, while much of the regulation will have to happen at the federal level as it should, it shouldn't necessarily be a patchwork of 50 states.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice165.wav| Yes, I'm for a two track system with that right office conversions are really difficult financially probably only about 3% of offices could actually make it work.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice81.wav| isn't always known for moving quickly, but this is one of those issues that we're going to have to speed up if we want to address it correctly.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice25.wav| It's a great question. I think a lot of what we'll see in the budget hearings coming up relate to that. And when we're engaging with agencies, when you say, you know, okay, here's the published numbers and here's the budget.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice111.wav| And when you start talking about government chat bots, well, perhaps there's a lot there to speed up interacting with the government. You have to be really worried about giving false information to a citizen that then relies upon.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice2.wav| People are concerned about what's going on about the state and the city budget, but they're also seeing the city continue to recover from COVID. And my district's really the economic engine for much of New York. And so we talked about.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice85.wav| The federal government leaves it up to states to regulate their own elections. And so while there's a bill at the federal level to require more disclosure of AI, that would only apply to congressional campaigns or presidential campaigns.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice19.wav| You know, I interact with data scientists and experts all the time.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice41.wav| Yes, and I want to get rid of it on the 100-year anniversary. That's the goal.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice88.wav| the disclaimer because it's tricky first amendment stuff when you start saying campaigns especially can do this or can't do this and then what exactly is that generative AI? If I use Photoshop to touch up an image, when do you just go?
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice166.wav| And so if we can expand that 3% with an affordability provision, great. If the only way to make it work is as of right, great. That's housing that we didn't have before. So I want more housing. I want it at all levels. Yes. And when it comes to that.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice122.wav| The only way to house all of the people that want to be New Yorkers is to make sure that we're building new housing. And there's a lot of ways that have been discussed on this podcast and others to do that.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice101.wav| I think it's fair to say it's based on a program from Massachusetts a few years ago where the universities they realized they were paying a lot of money for compute, not necessarily AI research, but just normal data center compute.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice87.wav| campaign ad or material was made with AI. That's one of my top priorities to get through this year.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice134.wav| So in the state of the district yesterday, I talked about two new proposals, not to say that they are the only thing to do here or the most important thing to do here, but I think coming from an angle that hasn't been seen before.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice95.wav| You know, those are the places where we should be really careful that the systems are acting in the ways that we expect and deciding the way that a human would ahead of time or in some cases even better than a human would.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice96.wav| What exactly is that generative AI? You know, if I use Photoshop to touch up an image, when do you just go? So starting with it, let's just get the information out there. Let's see how it's being used. And that doesn't need to be our last word on the subject. But let's not let this keep going without more knowledge about it. Good points. The second piece of that is what are we doing about regulating government use? You know, this popped up. Mayor Adams was apparently doing some government robo calls where they were putting his voice into other languages and not disclosing that this was AI generated, that it sounded like Mayor Adams was speaking in a variety of tongues to his constituents, and all of a sudden he had learned everybody's languages. What are we doing about regulating government use of AI? Yeah, and I maybe it's a minority view, but I actually think doing creative things like robo calls in different languages is a good use of AI with the caveat that there should be a disclaimer at the start that that's how it was generated. But I thought that was a creative way to reach out to people in their own language. Just, you know, be transparent about what exactly is happening. How government uses AI will be more and more part of the conversation. So ITS, the state agency responsible for IT, put out a 1.0 guideline for the state use of AI last week, which I'm sure will be reformed over time, but really focuses on where AI is making a decision that was previously made by a human. Those are the places to focus on. And it's more specific than just making a decision because your spam filter is making decisions about what to put in spam, what to put in your inbox, and that's a early form of AI. And there are cyber issues that are making decisions. So it's not just about decisions, but it's decisions that will impact human lives or that were previously made by a human. You know, those are the places where we should be really careful that the systems are acting in the ways that we expect and deciding the way that a human would ahead of time, or in some cases, even better than a human would. So we'll learn over time as that develops, but certainly it shouldn't be a ban all of AI use in government, nor should it be anything that's fast or is good, right?
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice16.wav| It's tough to tweet out a study or tweet out good data. And so maybe in what gets filtered out, especially to those who aren't as rapid listeners of your podcast as I am, maybe the pieces that they pick up feel uninformed by data.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice30.wav| So inputs can give a good sense of where we're going, but often outputs requires survey data or require a follow-up interview or analysis or deeper bits. And so we need to...
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice144.wav| rent-regulated unit and it's truly you need to do repairs to get it up to code, the government should put a bunch of money in to help support that. And the way I've come up to pay for that
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice92.wav| the state agency responsible for IT put out a 1.0 guideline for the state use of AI last week, which I'm sure will be reformed over time, but really focuses on where AI is making a decision that was previously made by a human.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice99.wav| When you think about the promise of AI, it's going to diagnose diseases and cure diseases in a way that we haven't seen before.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice80.wav| as just one example, Nvidia, the maker of the chips that are used to actually power AI research, recently took all of their corporate knowledge, all of the bug reports, all of their schematics for chips, and put that into an AI system to help develop new chips.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice115.wav| And so what it did was it created a AskRabbit account and then created a task to help with CAPTCHAs.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice110.wav| around New York. So I think that's a really good initiative if we can land it correctly. And then on the concerned side, these new AI platforms, generative AI, are known to hallucinate is the word, they'll maybe make up fast.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice42.wav| And because it just delays trials, it delays justice, it raises the cost for anyone who's interacting with the court system. And we know that justice delayed is justice denied.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice23.wav| Or are you going to take this caveat or something that's less sure and tweet that out and then all of a sudden that's some controversial story.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice153.wav| But these are active conversations and I find often the best policies come from maybe everyone came in with an original idea of what they thought was possible and then they hit re-
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice52.wav| And not to get too far field, but you have criminal court, you have civil court, you have individual village courts, you have the Court of Claims, which is against New York State, you have family court, you have housing court, you know, these quickly grow.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice159.wav| big. But I think if there's one perspective to share, it's that it doesn't necessarily have to be one big package, right? Regardless of what that package includes, that's not going to be the end of what we do in housing. There's going to be additional
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice40.wav| because there is a limit in the New York State Constitution on the total number of judges per jurisdiction based on population that was put there originally in 1925, which for those counting at home is the Coolidge administration.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice18.wav| But part of building a data informed government is less about the tech and what's available and also more about just building trust.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice138.wav| would agree with that for 90% of people that's reducing their fees. But there is the subset, which you alluded to.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice33.wav| It's aspects such as looking at the overall rental landscape that can tell us more maybe than starts and stops of apartments.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice38.wav| And the good news is that in this past legislative session and my first, I was able to author a bill with Senator Hoylman Siegel that created 20 new judges throughout New York state in order to reduce the backlog.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice150.wav| no sense. And so if we can take some of that potential.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice12.wav| worked at AI companies before as well. That will allow us to craft better legislation. I think everyone has a role in where technology is going and in how we should regulate AI.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice164.wav| to share, it's that it doesn't necessarily have to be one big package, right? Regardless of what that package includes, that's not going to be the end of what we do in housing. There's going to be additional steps needed. And I worry that we're waiting so long to pass the grand bargain that we miss a bunch of wins along the way. And people are struggling now. People are getting evicted now. People can't find a place to live now. And so I always tense up a little bit when I hear legislators say, I'm not going to vote for anything in this whole sector unless it includes A, and someone else says not unless it includes B, and someone else not includes C. You know, I think you can evaluate proposals separately. And I realize why compromise is important and why we might need to group a few of these together in order to get a majority on any of them. So if a grand bargain is what gets it done, great. If passing individual things is what gets it done, great. But we need to pass things today. And so I know everyone's bringing that urgency, and I hope we show that same urgency when it comes to finding compromise or compromises to actually make progress for New York.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice63.wav| How this came to me a little bit was during the campaign hearing people from a criminal justice reform perspective talking about how long people were languishing in Rikers and
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice66.wav| you delay that, that hurts safety and that hurts the reform efforts. And so I was advocating we need more judges, we need more judges and through the
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice50.wav| But the short version is that there's many different courts within New York. I think the most any other state has is like three or five. You know, you have criminal, civil and appellate, maybe a few others here. And New York has 10, 11, 12 different courts.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice65.wav| And realizing that in both cases, the problem was that trials were taking way too long. Ultimately, everyone wants a trial. We want a fair adjudication of what the alleged crime is.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice112.wav| on it. But I do, as someone who understands AI and has worked in AI and is generally bullish on AI, I do want people to take the downside risk fairly serious.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice47.wav| So the soonest this could be on the ballot would be 2025, more likely 2026. We like to put it in times where there's more voter turnouts and where people can be involved. But often ballot initiatives fail. Often these amendments fail.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice119.wav| So we absolutely need to be careful when we, especially when we're unleashing these, connecting to the internet, connecting to data systems, there's a lot of safety work that still needs to be done.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice140.wav| standards on apartments. And again, these are usually good standards. It's a best
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice89.wav| I noticed that Bill, which makes a lot of sense to me, at least to have a disclosure there. I have questions about whether campaigns should sort of be allowed to use fake voices, videos, et cetera, but that is the world we're living in. I don't know, there's some interesting questions there about whether it should be allowed or it should have to have a disclaimer. But, and feel free to give your thoughts on why, you know, regulated with a disclaimer versus harsher regulations. I mean, I think you start with a disclaimer because it's tricky first amendment stuff when you start saying campaigns especially can do this or can't do this. And then what exactly is that generative AI? You know, if I use Photoshop to touch up an image, when do you just go? So starting with a let's just get the information out there. Let's see how it's being used. And that doesn't need to be our last word on the subject, but let's not let this keep going without more knowledge about it.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice56.wav| And so Manhattan has been at the limit for many, many years. The Bronx and Staten Island reached the limit two years ago, and Queens and Brooklyn are coming up close behind.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice70.wav| But the key thing is that we have to pass it this year, because if not, that's a two-year delay.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice26.wav| Here's what you're willing to talk about, but let's talk about places that might be trickier. I'm in conversation right now with the MTA, for example, where they have a very comprehensive cost containment study, which I found to be quite compelling.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice124.wav| That's particularly pertinent in my district, where an independent design firm has found 135 offices that are good candidates for potential conversion.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice151.wav|
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice146.wav| It's always shocking to me that there was any vacant land in New York City.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice61.wav| So yes, judges are expensive, but if we can speed up trials, if we can get rid of some of the delays that we're seeing and scheduling your next court date, because we only have so many judges that can hear cases in the long run, that might even save money that might even pay for itself. And that's not the point. The point is we need faster trials to get real justice, but there's real savings that you can have.
/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice29.wav| It's demanding the right metrics. You know, it's a lot easier to measure inputs than it is to measure outputs.

And so that's the place where we're saying, why are we treating this differently? Why are we delaying our trials? Manhattan has actually been at the limit for decades.

/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice143.wav| I had Braunstein this year to pass a new version of the J51 program that provided tax breaks for people to do necessary repairs. But I want to go even further in saying if this is a rent regulated unit and it's truly you need to do repairs to get it up to code, the government should put a bunch of money in to help support that. And the way I've come up to pay for that is actually looking at how we under tax vacant land. You know, I grew up in New York City and it was always shocking to me that there was any vacant land in New York City. It just makes no sense. And it turns out the reason that some of that is is we hardly under tax it. No property in New York is actually taxed at its market value. That's a good thing. I'm not saying we should massively raise those taxes, but it is egregious when you look at vacant land that we are so under taxing it. If we just taxed holes in the ground in New York City at the market value for a hole in the ground, not what it'll be once it's built up, not its potential, just what it would sell for on the open market today, that would raise an extra $800 million a year for New York City. Now, maybe we don't go the full way. Maybe we look at housing versus commercial. There's details to be worked out there, but that's a subsidy to not build that makes no sense. And so if we can take some of that potential revenue, put that towards funding repairs for rent-regulated apartments, maybe we can introduce a little more building on vacant land and get more of those vacant units back online.

/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice125.wav| Often they're not allowed to because we allowed with the FAR cap, you could build taller for commercial than you could for housing.

/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice28.wav| better conversations about how we oversee the MTA. So it's being able to have those conversations, especially with agencies in places where they're unsure, that can move us forward.

/home/henryj/deepfake/training_data/MyTTSDataset/wavs/AlexBoresVoice123.wav| I think we need a new tax break for affordable housing, especially tied to labor standards that could generate more of the housing that we need. We certainly need to look at office conversion.
