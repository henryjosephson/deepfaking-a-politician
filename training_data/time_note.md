it took henry a little over an hour to collect this training data, and the overwhelming majority of that time was spent just listening to the podcast and noting when AB started and stopped speaking.

This step could probably be done more efficiently by using audio diarization software like pyannote-audio or whisperx, but I also wanted to actually listen to the podcast ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
