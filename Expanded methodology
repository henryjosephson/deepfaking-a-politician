Below are some specifics of how we measured the ‘cost’ components of our results. The definitions are mostly self-explanatory, but we have expanded on them for the sake of completeness and to include more specifics. 

Time: Quantity of time expended on model research and model creation, as tracked by productivity-monitoring service QBserve. 

Compute: Quantity of compute required for the creation and output generation of our homegrown TTS. We employed the University of Chicago’s Midway3 virtual machine for our model’s computation/processing, so we measured this metric via Midway units. 

Money: The financial cost of utilizing a given TTS method, including cloud computing services or other paid variables that were utilized in creation. All services were free except for ElevenLabs. Utilizing Midway usage would have a financial cost had Professor Trimble not been kind enough to let us use some of his Midway credits, so we include this caveat in the results table.
